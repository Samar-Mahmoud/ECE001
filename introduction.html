<h2><i><u>Introduction to AI</u></i></h2>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Definition:</b></li>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific<br/>
applications of AI include&nbsp;expert system, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition and&nbsp;machine vision. The ability <br/>
of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently <br/>
applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to <br/>
reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.</p>
 
  <li><b>AI Programming Languages:</b></li>
<p>AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. A number of programming<br/> 
languages exist that are used to build Artificial Intelligence systems. General programming languages such as C++ and Java are often used because<br/>
these are the languages with which most computer scientists have experience. There also exist two programming languages that have features that<br/> 
make them particularly useful for programming Artificial Intelligence projects PROLOG and LISP.</p>
  
  <li><b>Strong AI & Weak AI:</b></li>
<p>AI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained to complete<br/>
a specific task. Industrial robots and virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, use weak AI.<br/> 
Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), describes programming that can replicate the cognitive abilities of the human<br/> 
brain. When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system can use fuzzy logic to apply knowledge from one domain to another and find<br/> 
a solution autonomously. In theory, a strong AI program should be able to pass both a Turing test and the Chinese room test.</p>
