<h2><i><u>Examples & Applications of AI</u></i></h2> 

<p><i>Examples of AI technology:</i></p>
  <ul>
<li><b>Automation:</b> When paired with AI technologies, automation tools can expand the volume and types of tasks performed. An example is robotic<br/> 
process automation (RPA), a type of software that automates repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done by humans.</li><br/>
<li><b>Machine vision:</b> This technology gives a machine the ability to see. Machine vision captures and analyzes visual information using a camera,<br/> 
analog-to-digital conversion and digital signal processing. It is often compared to human eyesight, but machine vision isn't bound by biology and can<br/> 
be programmed to see through walls, for example.</li><br/> 
<li><b>Robotics:</b> This field of engineering focuses on the design and manufacturing of robots. Robots are often used to perform tasks that are<br/> 
difficult for humans to perform or perform consistently. For example, robots are used in assembly lines for car production or by NASA to move large<br/> 
objects in space.</li><br/>
<li><b>Self-driving cars:</b> Autonomous vehicles use a combination of computer vision, image recognition and deep learning to build automated skill<br/> 
at piloting a vehicle while staying in a given lane and avoiding unexpected obstructions.</li>
  </ul><br/>
  
<p><i>Applications of AI:</i></p>
  <ul>
<li><b>AI in healthcare:</b> The biggest bets are on improving patient outcomes and reducing costs. Companies are applying machine learning to make<br/> 
better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known healthcare technologies is IBM Watson. It understands natural language and can respond<br/> 
to questions asked of it.</li><br/> 
<li><b>AI in business:</b> Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and customer relationship management (CRM) platforms to<br/> 
uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have been incorporated into websites to provide immediate service to customers.<br/> 
Automation of job positions has also become a talking point between academics and IT analysts.</li><br/> 
<li><b>AI in education:</b> AI can automate grading, giving educators more time. It can assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work<br/> 
at their own pace. AI tutors can provide additional support to students, ensuring they stay on track. And it could change where and how students learn,<br/> 
perhaps even replacing some teachers.</li><br/> 
<li><b>AI in transportation:</b> In addition to AI's fundamental role in operating autonomous vehicles, AI technologies are used in transportation to<br/>  
manage traffic, predict flight delays, and make ocean shipping safer and more efficient.</li>
  </ul>
