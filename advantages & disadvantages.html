<li>AI would have a low error rate compared to humans, if coded properly. They would have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed.</li>
<li>They won't be affected by hostile environments, thus able to complete dangerous tasks, explore in space, and endure problems that would injure or kill us.</li>
<li>Replace humans in repetitive, tedious tasks and in many laborious places of work.</li>
<li>Predict what a user will type, ask, search, and do. They can easily act as assitants and cna recommend or direct various actions.</li>
<li>Organized and manages records.</li>
       </ul></td>
		<td><ul>
<li>Can cost a lot of money and time to build, rebuild, and repair. Robotic repair can occur to reduce time and humans needing to fix it, but that'll cost more money and resources.</li>
<li>This can prevent common sense occuring. Even if coded with common sense and to learn, it seems hard for them to get as much common sense that humans could.</li>
<li>Storage is expansive, but access and retrieval may not lead to connections in memory as well as humans could.</li>
<li>AI as robots can supercede humans, enslaving us.</li>
<li>As seen partially with smartphones and other technology already, humans can become too dependent on AI and lose their mental capacities.</li>
