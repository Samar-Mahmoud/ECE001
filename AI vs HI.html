<p>Intelligence can be defined as a general mental ability for reasoning, problem-solving, and learning. Because of its general nature,<br/> 
intelligence integrates cognitive functions such as perception, attention, memory, language, or planning. On the basis of this definition,<br/> 
intelligence can be reliably measured by standardized tests with obtained scores predicting several broad social outcomes such as educational<br/> 
achievement, job performance, health, and longevity. Letâ€™s study the differences between Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence in detail..</p>
