<p><b><i>What is Artificial Intelligence?</i></b></p>
<p>When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is robots.That's<br/> 
because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines. But nothing could be further from<br/> 
the truth. Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that<br/>  
a machine can easily mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The<br/> 
goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception. As technology advances, previous<br/> 
benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated. For example, machines that calculate basic<br/> 
functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial<br/> 
intelligence, since this function is now taken for granted as an inherent computer function. AI is continuously<br/> 
evolving to benefit many different industries. Machines are wired using a cross-disciplinary approach based in<br/> 
mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, and more.</p>
