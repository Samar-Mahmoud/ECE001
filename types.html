<h2><u><i>Types of AI</i></u></h2>    
<p>Artificial Intelligence can be categorized into four types, beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use <br />
today and progressing to sentient systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Reactive machines:</b></li>
<p>These AI systems have no memory and are task specific. An example is Deep Blue, the IBM chess program that beat Garry<br />
Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the chessboard and make predictions, but because it has no memory,<br />
it cannot use past experiences to inform future ones.</p>

  <li><b>Limited memory:</b></li>
<p>These AI systems have memory, so they can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making<br />
functions in self-driving cars are designed this way.</p>
  
  <li><b>Theory of mind:</b></li>
<p>Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it means that the system would have the social intelligence to<br />
understand emotions. This type of AI will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI<br />
systems to become integral members of human teams.</p>
  
  <li><b>Self-awareness:</b></li>
<p>In this category, AI systems have a sense of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand<br />
their own current state. This type of AI does not yet exist.</p>
